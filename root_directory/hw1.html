  <p style="background-color:Black;">This weekend I went to New York Comic Con where I took photos of various cosplayers. <br> With the large crowd of people, it was nearly impossible to avoid accidental photo bombers. <br> I wanted to learn how to blur backgrounds to make sure the focus was on the subjects of the photos. <br> I came across this YouTube tutorial that taught me an easy way to solve this problem. <br> It was surprisingly easy, and I learned this teqnique in just a few minutes thanks to the tutorial.</p>
